# ArmFlip - GROUP4
### Saba, Xio, Yunghsuan

### Main Goal
Develop an external tool that allows a Kinova Gen3 Lite robot arm to perform a complete flip, replicating natural human movement.

### Scope
- **Main System**: Kinova Gen3 Lite robot arm
- **System to Develop**: External tool/mechanism that enables flip motion
- **Target Movement**: Complete 360° flip

### Functional Requirements
 **Movement**
   - Complete controlled 360° rotation
   - Maintain stability during rotation
   - Return to starting position in controlled way

 **Control**
   - Integration with Kinova Kortex API (ROS 2, Python, C++)
   - Programmable and repeatable movement
   - Safety system (emergency stop)
   - Low-level control.

## CONCEPT EXPLORATION 

### CONCEPT 1: Rotating Base Platform 🔄
**Description**: Motorized circular platform that rotates 360° on central axis, carrying the Kinova Gen3 Lite through complete rotation.

#### Proposed Design:

    ===============  ← Circular platform (diameter ~1.2-1.5m)
         |||
      [DC Motor]
         |||
    ___Fixed Base___
```

#### Advantages:
✅ **Precise and smooth control**: Electronically controlled motor allows variable speed
✅ **Predictable movement**: Rotation on fixed axis, easy to program
✅ **High repeatability**: Same movement every time
✅ **Kortex API integration**: Synchronization between base motor and arm joints

#### Disadvantages:
⚠️ Motor needs sufficient torque 
⚠️ Requires quality bearings for smooth movement
⚠️ Minimum diameter ~1.2m for extended arm clearance
⚠️ Doesn't fully replicate "natural" flip movement

### CONCEPT 2: Circular Rail System (Track System) 🎡
**Description**: Wheel-like circular structure with rails/track where arm mounts and moves 360°, similar to a ferris wheel.

#### Proposed Design:

       ╲__________╱
           |||
       [Motor/Axis]
```

#### Advantages:
✅ **More "natural" movement**: Simulates flip trajectory with translation
✅ **Visually spectacular**: Complete wheel effect
✅ **Scalable**: Can vary diameter as needed
✅ **Multiple possible configurations**: Vertical, horizontal, or inclined
✅ **Lower motor torque**: Forces distributed in structure

#### Disadvantages:
⚠️ More complex structure to build 
⚠️ Cart/trolley sliding system needed
⚠️ More complex data/power transfer 
⚠️ More space required (minimum diameter ~2m for safety)
