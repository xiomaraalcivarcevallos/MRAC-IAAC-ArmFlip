## Overview

The initial idea and proposal for this project was to develop or propose an approach to how we can generate a flip somersault-like movement with a robotic arm, for which we researched on the internet about external axes or gantry systems. A gantry robot is a type of industrial robot, an automated piece of machinery applied in manufacturing or production, that utilizes a robot arm that is mounted either overhead on a rail system or a frame. In the gantry system, the beams hold up the robotic arm, creating an inflexible, stable structure. This arrangement allows gantry robots to move along the three linear axes: X, Y, and Z. They refer respectively to, horizontal movement from left to right, horizontal movement from the front to the back, and vertical movement up and down.

After analyzing these ideas, we decided to make some sketches about what would be most appropriate to implement for a cobot. First, we came up with a system that implements a rotating wheel system, which through guide rails allows the robot to move through that space. The second idea was to implement a structural system that elevates the robot, which also has a central rotary axis that allows it to perform the flip. We were able to visualize these sketches thanks to AI tools that allowed us to develop these images.

This project presents a **7th-Axis Rotary Gantry** (External Axis) engineered to transcend the workspace limitations and kinematic constraints of compact collaborative robots. While cobots like the **Universal Robots UR3e** offer industry-leading precision, their **500 mm reach** and fixed base often lead to **kinematic singularities**—mathematical points where the robot loses a degree of freedom and cannot move in specific directions—disqualifying them from large-format or complex industrial tasks.

**Core Innovation:** Our solution integrates the UR3e onto a rotary Robotic Transfer Unit (RTU). By introducing **Kinematic Redundancy**, we decouple the robot's motion from a static base. This "Workspace Multiplier" allows the system to **bypass singularity zones** (such as wrist alignment or elbow lock) by dynamically rotating the base. This ensures the robot can access areas and zones that are normally inaccessible due to the robot's inherent singularities, maintaining continuous, fluid motion throughout the entire process.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

#### Hardware
* **Robot:** Universal Robots UR3e (e-Series, Polyscope 5.x+).
* **Actuator:** Industrial AC Servo Motor (Mitsubishi MELSERVO-J4 or Panasonic Minas A6 Series) with IP65/67 rating to withstand paint particulates and overspray.
* **Transmission:** High-precision, low-backlash Planetary Gearbox (100:1 ratio).
* **Media Interface:** Industrial Slip Ring rated for Gigabit Ethernet (Profinet/EtherNet/IP) and high-pressure pneumatic supply.

#### Software
* **URCap** for External Axis integration and kinematic synchronization.
* **Communication Protocol:** EtherNet/IP or Modbus TCP for real-time motion handshaking.

### Installing

1.  **Mechanical Integration:** Mount the UR3e onto the rotary platform. Ensure the center of mass is aligned with the gantry’s axis of rotation to minimize inertial load on the servo drive.
2.  **Driver Configuration:** Configure the industrial servo-drive to operate as a slave to the UR3e controller via the Fieldbus interface.
3.  **Kinematic Calibration & Singularity Mitigation:** Perform a Tool Center Point (TCP) and External Axis Calibration. The system is programmed to use the 7th axis as a **"Redundancy Resolver"**—if the arm's trajectory approaches a singularity, the gantry rotates to reposition the robot’s base, keeping the arm within its optimal dexterity range and reaching zones otherwise blocked by joint limits.

## Demo
The system operates using a **Coordinated Spiral Kinematic Path**:

* **Initialization:** The robot returns to "Home" position and initializes LiDAR-based area scanners for safety monitoring.
* **Surface Parameters:** The operator inputs the target structure's radius and vertical coverage height.
* **Execution:**
    * **The 7th Axis** provides a constant tangential velocity, effectively rotating the workspace to prevent the robot from reaching its mechanical limits.
    * **Singularity Avoidance:** By moving the base, the system ensures the UR3e never hits a "dead zone," allowing it to **reach areas or zones that the robot normally cannot reach** due to kinematic singularities.
    * **The UR3e Arm** dynamically adjusts its extension to maintain the optimal standoff distance (150 mm).
    * **The HVLP spray nozzle** is triggered, creating a seamless, uniform coating without the stuttering or stops caused by 6-axis kinematic locking.
* **Completion:** Upon reaching the target height, the system executes a cleaning cycle and generates a material consumption report.
